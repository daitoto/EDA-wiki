### Formal Verfication
- [SymbiYosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/SymbiYosys) (Clifford Wolf)
  - Front-end for Yosys-based formal verification flows.
- [CoSA](https://github.com/cristian-mattarei/CoSA)
  - An SMT-based symbolic model checker for hardware design.

### SAT/SMT Solvers
- [SAT Competitions](http://satcompetition.org/)
  - To identify new challenging benchmarks and to promote new solvers for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) as well as to compare them with state-of-the-art solvers. 
- [SMT Competitions](https://smt-comp.github.io/)
  - To spur advances in SMT solver implementations on benchmark formulas of practical interest.

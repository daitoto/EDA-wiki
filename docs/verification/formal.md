### Formal Verfication
- [SymbiYosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/SymbiYosys) (Clifford Wolf)
  - Front-end for Yosys-based formal verification flows.
- [Pono](https://github.com/upscale-project/pono)
  - An SMT-based model checker built on smt-switch
- [AVR](https://github.com/aman-goel/avr)
  - Reads a state transition system and performs property checking (the winner of HWMCC'20)

### SAT/SMT Solvers and Model Checkers
- [SAT Competitions](http://satcompetition.org/)
  - To identify new challenging benchmarks and to promote new solvers for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) as well as to compare them with state-of-the-art solvers. 
- [SMT Competitions](https://smt-comp.github.io/)
  - To spur advances in SMT solver implementations on benchmark formulas of practical interest.
- [Hardware Model Checking Competitions](http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc/)
  - To encourage researchers to work on novel model checking engines.
